# InertialSense Serial Protocol

This repo is all the files you need to communicate with an inertialsense uINS and use the inertialsense serial protocol.

For an example implementation using the serial protocol, please see the [arduino example](http://docs.inertialsense.com/user-guide/serial_interface/) on the inertialsense website.
